I had a headache this morning, probably from stress. I took 400mg ibuprofen and felt better after 30 minutes. I also went for a 30-minute walk which improved my mood significantly. For lunch, I ate salmon with vegetables and drank 8 glasses of water throughout the day. My sleep quality was good last night - I slept for 7.5 hours. I'm feeling energized and my blood pressure is normal at 120/80.
